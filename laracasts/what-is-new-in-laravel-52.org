 It's about that time again. Laravel 5.2 is on its way, with a variety of useful new additions. Let's get ahead of the game, and begin reviewing what's new.

   Laravel has offered route model binding for some time now. However, with Laravel 5.2, much of this process is now implicit. Need to fetch a record by its id? Just typehint the model, and Laravel will automatically send you the proper instance of it.
   - =$this->router->bind('route_name', clouser)=
   - Route wildcard name must the same as the clouser parameter name
