* The Lifecycle of a New Feature
   Want to join me, as I implement a new feature for Laracasts from scratch? Yes? Great! What exactly will we be tackling? Well, I'd like offer visitors, who don't desire a subscription, the option of buying single videos on a one-off basis. We'll use Behat to help with this.

** The Needs of the Business
   In this opening lesson of "The Lifecycle of a Feature", we'll take some time to dicuss the needs of the business. What feature are we implementing? Who is it for? What benefit does it have? How do we expect it to work? To get this information on paper, so to speak, we'll leverage Behat.

** Purchasing a Lesson
   In this lesson, we'll take some time to describe how a user might go about purchasing a lesson. What shape might that process take?

** Scenarios and Refacotring
   In this final episode, we'll refactor the FeatureContext class, while adding two more scenarios to describe the expected behavior of our "single purchases" feature.
