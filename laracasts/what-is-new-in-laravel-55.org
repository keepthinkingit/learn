* STARTED What's New in Laravel 5.5
  Here we go again! Currently scheduled for an Augest release date, we're on the verge of Laravel 5.5. With that in mind, let's get a head start on the new features and additions to the framework. As always, there's quite a few!

** DONE Laravel 5.5 Installation and Whoops!
   CLOSED: [2018-07-20 Fri 10:53]
   - State "DONE"       from "STARTED"    [2018-07-20 Fri 10:53]
   Let's get started by *installing*, at the time of this recording, the development version of Laravel. That way, we can pull in the 5.5 version of the framework. Once setup, we'll also take a quick look at the new =Whoops= intergration.

** DONE Streamlined Request Validation

   A small, but long-requested addition, you may now send a =validate= message directly on your =Request= instance. Event better, this method call will return the validated data, which means you can pass the request directly to your model's =create= or =update= methods. Simpler code for the win!
   - CSRF exception: the page durning the inactive state.
   - Old validation workflow
     #+BEGIN_SRC php
       public function store()
       {
           $this->validate(request(), [
               'title' => 'required',
               'body' => 'required'
           ]);

           Post::create([request('title', 'body')]);

           return 'Done';
       }
     #+END_SRC
   - Now validation workflow
     #+BEGIN_SRC php
       public function store()
       {
           $validateData = request()->validate([
               'title' => 'required',
               'body' => 'required'
           ]);

           Post::create($validateData);

       }
     #+END_SRC

** DONE Fresh Migrations
   CLOSED: [2018-07-20 Fri 11:16]
   - State "DONE"       from "STARTED"    [2018-07-20 Fri 11:16]
   A new =migrate:fresh= Artisan command is being introduced as part of Laravel 5.5. This is similar to the existing =refresh= option, however, rather than rolling back all of your migrations (and triggering the respective =down= method for each), this new command will simply drow all tables and run your migrations fron scratch.

** DONE Frontend Presets
   CLOSED: [2018-07-20 Fri 11:25]
   - State "DONE"       from "STARTED"    [2018-07-20 Fri 11:25]
   Out of the box, Laravel ships with a small bit of boilterplate to get you up and running as quickly as possible. Specifically, it includes a few Sass and Vue suggestions. However, as part of Laravel 5.5, you may now configure this initial boilterplate top your liking. Want to strip all of it? Now you can. Prefer to use React instead of Vue? Easy!
   =php artisan preset:none=

** DONE Automatic Package Discovery
   CLOSED: [2018-07-20 Fri 11:34]
   - State "DONE"       from "STARTED"    [2018-07-20 Fri 11:34]
   If you've ever installed a Laravel package before, you most certainly were required to visit your =config/app.php= file to add a service provider and alias. This is what allows the package to bootstrap itself into your Laravel installation. In Laravel 5.5, however, packages can optionally perform these steps automatically. In this video, we'll update existing Laracasts package to allow for this very thing.

** DONE Faster Email Testing
   CLOSED: [2018-07-20 Fri 11:42]
   - State "DONE"       from "STARTED"    [2018-07-20 Fri 11:42]
   Testing the layout of your mailables can always be a little tricky. Usually, we resort to sending the email to a test email server like =Mailtrap=, and then reviewing the output. In Laravel 5.5, however, we can now return a mailable class instance directly from any route. convenient.
   - =Renderable= interface
   - Render email
     #+BEGIN_SRC php
       Route::get('/', function() {
           return new App\Mail\Welcome;

       })
     #+END_SRC

** DONE Silky Smooth Custom Validation Rules
   CLOSED: [2018-07-20 Fri 12:36]
   - State "DONE"       from "STARTED"    [2018-07-20 Fri 12:36]
   In Laravel 5.5, you'll find a brand new =App/Rule= folder. The next time you require custom logic for a particular request attribute, you'll laugh at how simple it now is.
   - =php artisan make:rule=

** DONE Collection Dumping
   CLOSED: [2018-07-20 Fri 12:43]
   - State "DONE"       from "STARTED"    [2018-07-20 Fri 12:43]
   Debugging a complex collection pipeline can get a little tricky. Often, you'll find yourself temporarily commenting out portions of code, as you confirm the dumped output. In Laravel 5.5, you'll find two new helper methods on your collection instances: =dump()= and =dd()=

** DONE Model Factory Generation
   CLOSED: [2018-07-20 Fri 12:47]
   - State "DONE"       from "STARTED"    [2018-07-20 Fri 12:47]
   In Larave 5.4, all model factories were contained within a single file. Need to construct a new factory? Well, you know the drill: copy and paste the one bofer it, and make your changes. Luckily though, in 5.5, there's a simpler way. Each of your Eloquent models will now have a respective model factory file.
   =php artisan make:factory Video=

** DONE Custom Blade "If" Directives
   CLOSED: [2018-07-20 Fri 12:56]
   - State "DONE"       from "STARTED"    [2018-07-20 Fri 12:56]
   In Laravel 5.5, you'll find a sweet new syntax for defining custom =if= Blade directives. Want a useful =@subscriber= directive to conditionally load HTML for only the subscribers of your site? It's so easy! Give me a few moments, and I 'll show you how.
   - Syntax In service provider.
     #+BEGIN_SRC php
       \Blade::if('member', function() {
           return true;
       });
     #+END_SRC

** DONE What's New in Laravel Mix
   CLOSED: [2018-07-20 Fri 13:49]
   - State "DONE"       from "STARTED"    [2018-07-20 Fri 13:49]
   Though Mix is entirely separte from Laravel 5.5, you will find a bump to version 1.0 in your packages.json file. In this video, we'll review a few new additions, including updated versioning, sequential custom tasks, fast SASS compilation, CSS purification, and more.
   - =mix.sass()=
   - =mix.fastSass()=
   - =mix.copy()=
   - =mix.combine([])=
   - =mix.option({ purifyCss: true})=
