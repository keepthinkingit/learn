* Scaling Laravel
** Laravel Performance

*** Optimize Command
    We cover the =php artisan optimize= command.

    We run this a lot (in laravel 5.5 and under) because it's defined in the =post-install-cmd= and =post-update-cmd= areas defined in the =composer.json= file.

    This command caches Laravel's service (Service Providers and their dependency/load order) definitions.


    - =composer dump-autoload --optimize=


*** The Route Cache
    We cover the route cache.
    Registering and matching requests to a route is a slow process. Caching the route registration and their class/dependency mappings/middleware (and so on) saves time on every request!
    The only caveat is that we cannot save routes that user Clousers. All routes must point to a Controller class to use the route cache.
    =php artisan route:cache=
