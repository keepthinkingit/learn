* Docker Basic

** Installing Docker for Mac/Windows

** The Docker Commands
   We explore the three commands available to us after installing Docker on our computer
   1. =docker= - the main command, manage the life cycle of docker containers
   2. =docker-compose= - coordinate the use of multiple containers (services) using a yaml file.
   3. =docker-machine= - spin up servers, install Docker, and let us control them remotely.

** You First Container
   - =docker ps=
   - =docker ps -a=
   - =docker images=

** Inspecting Containers
   - =docker inspect=

** Cleaning Up
   - Container
     - =docker rm container_name_or_id=
     - =docker rm $(docker ps -aq)= remove all containers
     - =docker run -rm unbutu:16.04 ls -lah= remove the container when done running
   - Images
     - =docker images= list images
     - =docker rmi image_id_or_name:tag_combo= remove a specific image by ID or Name
     - =docker rmi $(docker images -q)= Remove all images

** Interacting with Container
   - =docker run ubuntu:16.04 bash=
   - =docker run ubuntu:16.04 -i -t ubuntu:16.04 bash=
   - =docker stop container_name_or_id=
   - =docker start container_name_or_id=

** Nginx & Sharing Ports
   - =docker run -it -p 80:80 ubuntu:16.04 bash=

** Sharing Volumes
   - =docker run -it -p 80:80 -v ~/dockertest:/var/www/html ubuntu:16.04 bash=

** Reviews

* Docker Images & Everyday Use

** Committing Changes
   - =docker diff container_name_or_id=
   - =docker commit -a "Chris Fidao" -m "Installed nginx" container_name_or_id shippingdocker/nginx:0.1.0=
   - =docker history shippingdocker/nginx:0.1.0=

** The Dockerfile
   - =docker build=

** Building a PHP Image

** Linking Nginx & PHP Containers
   - =docker exec -it zen_einstein bash=

** Pushing to Docker Hub
   - =docker login=
   - =docker push=
   - =docker pull=

** Linking the Full Stack

** Docker Networking
   - =docker network=

** Docker Volumes
   - =docker volume -h=
   - =docker volume ls=

* Addendum 1
** Official Images on Docker Hub

** Advanced Dockerfiles: MySQL

* Wraning Containers with Docker Compose

** Indroducing Docker Compose
   - =docker-compose -h=
** Docker Compose Basic
   - =docker-compose up -d=
   - =docker-compose ps=
** Serving a Real Application
** Bulding Images with Docker Compose
** Explaining the =docker-compose up= Command
** Variables with Docker Compose
** Extending Docker Compose Files
   1. Use a 2nd docker-compose file to add to a base file
   2. Use a 2nd docker-compose file that explicitly extends parts of a base file


   =docker-compose -f docker-compose.base.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d=
